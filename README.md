## Analysis Objective

* Validate and characterize the **EKAR** muon detector (low statistics $\approx 230$ CPM) by comparing it with the **OULU** neutron monitor (high statistics $\approx 5000$ CPM, scientific standard), during a significant solar activity event (*Forbush Decrease*).

* Quantify **how** the different physics (Muons vs Neutrons) and the different geographical position influence the measurements.



## Methodology

Since **OULU** has a much higher temporal and statistical resolution, several *resampling* and *scaling* steps are performed:

- **Resampling:** transformation of high-frequency **OULU** data into an hourly *confidence band* (Min-Max and IQR).

- **Scaling:** Estimation of the coefficient $k \approx 0.043$ to bring the **OULU** signal intensity to the **EKAR** scale.

The assumption is: if **EKAR** measured exactly the same physics as **OULU**, its signal should remain confined within this band.



## Performed Analyses

Three main analyses were performed, each with a specific purpose:

1. **Positioning Analysis (Fan Chart)**

 Verification of signal stability and response to the event, by superimposing the **EKAR** trend on the **OULU** confidence bands.

 **Result:**
 
 - In the quiet phase, **EKAR** navigates stably within the band.
 
 - During the *Forbush Decrease*, **EKAR** exits the band going into **Overshoot**.
 
 **Interpretation:** **EKAR** undergoes a smaller percentage decrease compared to **OULU** because muons, generated by more energetic primary cosmic rays, are less influenced by the Earth's magnetic field.

2. **Cross-Correlation**

 Quantify the time delay between the two instruments, due to the different geographical position, via cross-correlation on hourly data.
 
 **Result:** there is a systematic delay of **+2 hours** for **EKAR** compared to **OULU**.
 
 **Interpretation:** This delay is the sum of two factors:
 
 1. **Earth Rotation:** Longitude difference (~1 hour).
 
 2. **Physics (Rigidity):** The different curvature of particles in the Earth's magnetic field causes **EKAR** to "look" in a different asymptotic direction.
 
 _This result is confirmed by a previous analysis comparing the day-night trend of counts for the two detectors._

3. **Phase Space**

 Study the dynamics of the event, i.e., how the system reacts and recovers, by plotting **OULU** on the $x$ axis and **EKAR** on the $y$ axis, coloring the points based on time.
 
 **Result:** a **hysteresis cycle** is visible, a counter-clockwise loop instead of a straight line.
 
 **Interpretation:** **EKAR** recovers the pre-event signal level much faster than **OULU**. High-energy particles feel the magnetic disturbance less than low-energy ones.    


## Conclusions
	
Despite the low statistics and intrinsic noise (requiring smoothing like the moving average), **EKAR is validated** and _sees the same physics as **OULU**_. 

The fundamental difference is the **Cutoff Rigidity** $R_c$:

- **OULU (~0.8 GV):** Measures neutrons generated by low-energy primaries. It is extremely sensitive to solar variations with deep peaks and slower recoveries.

- **EKAR (~4.0 GV):** Measures muons generated by high-energy primaries. It is less sensitive with less marked peaks during solar storms and fast recoveries.
 
Finally, the 2-hour delay is not a defect, but a characteristic of its acceptance cone in the geomagnetic field and relative position.

In conclusion, **EKAR** is a complementary and much less expensive instrument (**EKAR** $\sim$ €2800) that probes a more energetic portion of the cosmic ray spectrum.
